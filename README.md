# Readers-and-Writer
Multi-threaded C program that gives readers priority over writers concerning a shared (global) variable. Essentially, if any readers are waiting, then they have priority over writer threads-writers can only write when there are no readers. Constraints:  Multiple readers/writers must be supported (5 of each is fine), Readers must read the shared variable X number of times, Writers must write the shared variable X number of times, Output: The number of readers present when value is read, Writers output: The number of readers present were when value is written (should be 0), before a reader/writer attempts to access the shared variable it should wait some random amount of time.
